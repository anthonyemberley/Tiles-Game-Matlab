# Tiles-Game-Matlab

This is a game based off the iPhone application 'Tiles' and many other iterations.  I created this game for a final project in a class.  The way you play is by using the left, up and right arrow keys coordinating to the tile locations.  Don't touch the white tiles!

It is very highly commented because of the nature of the class.

Enjoy!
